## Introduction

Today more than ever we live with smart devices and personal assistants that work together to make our environment a more comfortable, efficient and personalized place. This project aims to contribute to the same field by suggesting a radical change in how we interact with smart things.

Sometimes it can be inconvenient to have to ask a personal assistant to turn our appliances on or off. Because it's simply too late at night to be talking, or because we're watching our favorite movie and we don't want annoying audio interrupting us.

This is why I thought "What if we could control the whole house with just gestures?" It would be amazing to just point to the air conditioner and have it turn on, turn off the light, and turn on our TV.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

To develop this project we will use a Brainchip Akida Development Kit and a Logitech BRIO 4K Webcam, together with an Edge Impulse Machine Learning model for pose identification.

### Akida Dev Kit

It should be noted that this kit is the main component of this project thanks to some interesting characteristics that make it ideal for this use case. This kit consists of a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 with Wi-Fi and 8 GB RAM, also its IO Board, which includes a PCIe interface to carry an Akida PCIe board with the AKD1000 Neuromorphic Hardware Accelerator. 

Considering that our project will end up being one more smart device that we will have at home, it's crucial that it can do its job efficiently and with very low energy consumption. This is where Brainchip's technology makes sense. Akida™ neuromorphic processor mimics the human brain to analyze only essential sensor inputs at the point of acquisition—processing data with unparalleled performance, precision, and economy of energy.
